# France Template Validation - VBA Excel File

## Description
This Excel template is a **validation-based tool** tailored for France-specific data requirements. Built using VBA, it automates data integrity checks and enforces strict compliance with business rules. The goal is to simplify data management for users who may not be proficient with advanced tools like CRM systems or master data software, while ensuring error-free submissions.

## Why This Template?  
The client expressed a key business challenge:  
- Many of their sales and technical staff are not proficient with CRM or master data tools.  
- A simplified Excel-based solution was preferred to handle validations directly in a familiar environment, reducing the need for frequent back-and-forth queries.  

This template addresses these needs by incorporating most validation rules directly into the Excel file, enabling efficient, error-free data handling.

## Key Features
### 1. **User-Friendly Design**:
- Works exclusively on the `Actual Import Template` sheet.
- Drop-down options for the `Status` column to eliminate manual input errors.
- Clear error messages and color-coded highlights guide users to correct issues quickly.

### 2. **Validation Rules**:
- **Sheet-Specific**:
  - The sheet name must remain `Actual Import Template`.
  - Insertion of rows/columns is not allowed.
  - Header names cannot be modified.
- **Mandatory Fields**:
  - Must not be blank or exceed specified character limits.
  - Missing or incorrect values trigger errors and highlight fields in **red**.

### 3. **Conditional Formatting**:
- **Status = Approved**:
  - All mandatory fields must be correctly filled.
  - Missing or invalid data is highlighted in **red**.
- **Status = Reject**:
  - Only `EAN` and `Status` should be populated.
  - Any `France Marketing Content` provided in this case will be flagged in **red**.

### 4. **Error Reporting**:
- On saving, all errors are summarized for user review.
- Errors must be resolved before the file can be saved successfully.

### Instructions for Users:
1. **Choosing Status**:
   - Use the drop-down menu for `Status` values (`Approved` or `Reject`) to prevent manual input errors.
2. **Handling EANs**:
   - Ensure all rows between the first and last `EAN` have valid entries.
   - Missing `EANs` will trigger an error message.
3. **Correcting Errors**:

4. **Saving the File**:
   - Address all highlighted errors before saving to avoid interruptions.

   - Incorporate additional business-specific validations as requirements grow.

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Enable API or database connections for automated data input/output.
4. **Advanced Reporting**:
   - Add summary reports for frequently occurring errors to improve training and data quality over time.

## Best Practices
1. Always use the provided drop-down options for the `Status` column.
2. Avoid adding or deleting columns, as it disrupts the VBA validations.
3. Keep `Marketing Content` fields blank for `Reject` status to prevent errors.
4. Ensure all mandatory fields are filled correctly before saving.
